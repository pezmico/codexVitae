##Lexicon

* Live like a Hydra  https://medium.com/@buster/live-like-a-hydra-c02337782a89
* Hierarchy of goals http://lifehacker.com/5912971/focus-your-ambitions-with-the-lifehacker-hierarchy-of-goals

* Wabi Sabi: The Art of Imperfection
Wabi-sabi (侘寂?) represents a comprehensive Japanese world view or aesthetic centered on the acceptance of transience and imperfection. The aesthetic is sometimes described as one of beauty that is "imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete".[1] It is a concept derived from the Buddhist teaching of the three marks of existence (三法印 sanbōin?), specifically impermanence (無常 mujō?), the other two being suffering (苦 ku?) and emptiness or absence of self-nature (空 kū?).
Characteristics of the wabi-sabi aesthetic include asymmetry, asperity (roughness or irregularity), simplicity, economy, austerity, modesty, intimacy, and appreciation of the ingenuous integrity of natural objects and processes.

##Beliefs
### On Life
1. Having lived the most perfect moments by the end is the goal.
2. There is no destiny or fate. Everything is random and we choose to give it meaning (or not)
3. Knowledge is the greatest gift. There is no Knowledge that is not power.
4. Your problems, even if little, are yours to care about and solve.

### On People
1. Humans are all crazy. There is no such thing as normal.
2. What people say they want is very often not the same as what they really want.
3. Nobody cares as much as they say they do.

### On Love
1. Love exists and it is beautiful and powerful.
2. It is also quite rare.

##Chaos Monkey Tricks
* Changing schedules affects me a lot. I need different modes for different schedules aka routines. Shifting from Paul Henry show (night) to Firstline completely changed my routine and thus my scheduling.

##Personal Canon
* Be who you are, but try to improve it every chance you get.
* If you take the jump, ground will show up.
* There is always something positive. As sad as it may seem.
* Do not feel sorry for yourself.
* Say yes every time I can. Specially if it could lead to a new adventure.
